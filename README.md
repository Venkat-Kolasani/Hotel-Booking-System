## Overview

The **Hotel Booking System with Loyalty Program** is a C++ console-based application designed to manage hotel room bookings efficiently and reward loyal customers. It features room management, customer tracking, and a loyalty program, utilizing various standard libraries for robust functionality. Custom exception handling ensures graceful error management and a smooth user experience.

## Features

- **Room Management**: Supports different room types (Standard, Deluxe, Suite) with specific attributes,incentives and  pricing.
- **Dual Login**: Login for Admin and User is seperated with different functionality.
- **Customer Management**: Tracks customer information, including name, email, and loyalty points.
- **Booking Management**: Handles booking details, including customer information, room selection, check-in, and check-out dates.
- **Loyalty Program**: Rewards customers based on the duration of their stays, encouraging repeat business.
- **Error Handling**: Implements custom exception classes to manage errors gracefully.

## Technologies Used
